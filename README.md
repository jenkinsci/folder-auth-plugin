This plugin provides an easy way to configure permisisons inside Jenkins
through *roles* which can apply to multiple users. Three types of roles are
supported 'Global Roles', 'Folder Roles' and 'Agent Roles'.

To learn more about how to use this plugin, read the [docs](/docs/usage.md).
We also provide REST APIs for modifying the roles, check them out [here](/docs/rest-api.adoc).

## Reach out to us

You can chat with us, share your feedback and ask questions on our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin).
We share the channel with the [Role Strategy Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin)
because this plugin also follows a similar, though simplified, 'role-based' model and was created to
avoid the performance penalty of using regular expressions.

You can also reach out to us through Jenkins'
[Developer Mailing List](mailto:jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com).

## Reporting issues

Please create a ticket for any bug reports or feature requests on
[Jenkins JIRA](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/) and add `folder-auth-plugin`
as the 'Component'.

| Overall/Read               | Global Role        | The read permission is necessary for viewing almost all pages of Jenkins.
